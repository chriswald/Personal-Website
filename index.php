	Chris Wald is a second year Software Engineering student at the <a href="http://uwplatt.edu" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin - Platteville</a>.<br><br>
	During his high school (and middle school) years he was highly active in the local swim clubs and teams. This led him to pursue American Red Cross lifeguard certification, which he now holds. While he has never had long term employment as a lifeguard he has used his skills to help coworkers and has lifeguarded for a local school's fieldtrip.<br><br>
	During the summers Chris works at a local factory on the assembly floor, but he works on development projects of his own when he gets time. He has developed for Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, Blackberry, and the Web. Many of his projects are only for personal use, but some have seen more widespread deployment.<br><br>
	He's actually a little social too. You can find him on any of these sites:
